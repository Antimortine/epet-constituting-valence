## EPET in Dialogue: A Detailed Comparison with Other Models of Valence

The Emergentist-Predictive Experience Theory (EPET) offers a distinctive account of affective valence. While it shares foundational elements with other contemporary theories, particularly those rooted in Predictive Processing (PP) and interoception, its unique synthesis of these elements with Global Workspace Theory (GWT), a specific form of emergentist physicalism, and a constrained self-model leads to a novel explanatory framework. This section provides a more detailed comparison of EPET with key alternative approaches to valence, highlighting its specific contributions and how it addresses certain limitations of other models.

### 1. EPET vs. Standard PP/FEP Models of Valence (e.g., Seth & Friston, Solms, Fernandez Velasco & Loev)

*   **Shared Ground:** EPET fully embraces the core PP/FEP insight that valence is intimately tied to the predictive regulation of interoceptive states and the dynamics of prediction error or free energy [@SethFriston2016; @Solms2019; @FernandezVelascoLoev2021]. Mechanisms like the rate of change of prediction error, expected error reduction, and precision-weighting of interoceptive signals are considered fundamental by EPET as well.

*   **EPET's Distinctions & Advantages:**
    *   **Constitutive Explanation of Phenomenality:** While many PP/FEP models provide powerful functional or correlational accounts (e.g., valence *correlates with* error dynamics), EPET offers an explicit **constitutive** claim: valence *is* the intrinsic phenomenal character of this regulatory process when it meets specific architectural conditions (including global accessibility and self-model integration). This directly addresses the phenomenality gap often left open by purely formal or computational PP models. EPET aims to explain *why it feels like something* to undergo such regulation, not just what function that regulation serves.
    *   **Integration of GWT for Conscious Access:** Standard PP models often do not explicitly detail how valenced interoceptive states become consciously experienced. EPET integrates GWT to provide a plausible architectural mechanism for how precision-weighted, self-model-modulated interoceptive states achieve global broadcast, thereby becoming part of the conscious, reportable phenomenal scene. This addresses how valence transitions from a sub-personal regulatory signal to a subjective feeling.
    *   **Centrality of the Predictive Self-Model (Anattā-constrained):** EPET places greater emphasis on the **constitutive role of a dynamic, Anattā-constrained predictive self-model** in shaping the interpretation, intensity, and even the quality of valence (see Section 2.4). While some PP accounts acknowledge top-down influences, EPET elevates the self-model to a core architectural component that actively co-constructs affective experience, allowing for a richer explanation of complex emotions, individual differences, and the impact of narrative or existential beliefs on affect. This also offers a more nuanced response to the "problem of significance" by grounding it in the self-model's goals and viability concerns.
    *   **Explicit Emergentist Physicalism:** EPET's philosophical commitment to non-reductive emergentism provides a clear metaphysical framework for understanding how novel phenomenal properties (like valence) can arise from and be realized by complex physical processes without being reducible to them, and without positing dualistic entities.

### 2. EPET vs. Psychological Constructivism (e.g., Barrett's Theory of Constructed Emotion)

*   **Shared Ground:** EPET shares with constructivist theories, like Lisa Feldman Barrett's Theory of Constructed Emotion [@Barrett2017], the emphasis on active inference, the importance of interoception (as "core affect" or "body budget" signals), and the role of top-down conceptualization in shaping emotional experience. Both reject the idea of fixed, biologically basic emotion circuits for discrete emotions.

*   **EPET's Distinctions & Advantages:**
    *   **Nature of Core Valence:** While Barrett views core affect (valence and arousal) as basic ingredients that are then categorized into discrete emotions, EPET proposes that foundational valence itself is already a constituted phenomenal property of interoceptive predictive regulation, prior to extensive conceptualization. The "feeling" of good/bad is intrinsic to the regulatory success/failure. Conceptualization by the self-model then *differentiates and nuances* this foundational valence into specific emotions, rather than *creating* valence de novo from non-affective interoceptive signals plus concepts.
    *   **Emphasis on Architectural Integration (GWT):** EPET provides a more explicit role for GWT in explaining how these constructed or modulated affective states become consciously experienced.
    *   **Philosophical Grounding:** EPET's emergentist physicalism offers a specific ontological account for the "feeling" aspect, aiming to avoid potential accusations of functionalism or eliminativism that constructivist theories sometimes face regarding raw phenomenal feel.

### 3. EPET vs. Higher-Order Theories (HOR) of Consciousness

*   **Key Difference:** HOR theories posit that a mental state becomes conscious only when it is the target of a higher-order mental state (a thought or perception) [@CarruthersGennaro2020]. EPET, for basic affective valence, is a **first-order theory**: the phenomenal quality is intrinsic to the (globally accessible, integrated) first-order predictive regulatory state itself.

*   **EPET's Advantages:**
    *   **Avoids HOR Problems:** EPET sidesteps common issues with HOR theories, such as the problem of what makes the higher-order state itself conscious (potential regress) or how a non-conscious first-order state acquires phenomenality merely by being represented.
    *   **Role of Self-Model for Self-Awareness, Not Basic Qualia:** While EPET's self-model allows for meta-representation of one's own states (akin to a higher-order function), this is for *self-awareness* or reflective consciousness about affect, not for the constitution of the basic affective quale itself.

### 4. EPET vs. Illusionism

*   **Key Difference:** Strong illusionism denies the reality of phenomenal consciousness (qualia) as traditionally conceived, suggesting it's a cognitive illusion [@Dennett1991consciousness; @Frankish2016]. EPET **affirms the reality of phenomenal experience and valence** as emergent properties of physical processes.

*   **EPET's Stance:** EPET argues that while our *conceptualizations* or folk theories about qualia might be partly mistaken (aligning with a weak illusionism or conceptual critique), the underlying first-person experience of, for example, pleasantness or unpleasantness is a genuine phenomenon to be explained, not explained away. EPET's constitutive account aims to naturalize this phenomenon within an emergentist physicalist framework.

### 5. EPET vs. Enactive/Ecological Approaches

*   **Shared Ground:** EPET incorporates strong enactivist and embodied principles, emphasizing the active, agentive nature of perception and cognition, and the grounding of experience in brain-body-environment interactions. It resonates with the enactive critique regarding the "problem of significance" by linking valence to organismic viability and goal-directed self-regulation.

*   **EPET's Distinctions & Contributions:**
    *   **Specific Mechanisms (PP & GWT):** While enactive theories often provide rich philosophical accounts of embodiment and agency, EPET offers a more detailed mechanistic proposal by integrating PP (for content generation and regulation) and GWT (for conscious access and integration), framed within its emergentist philosophy.
    *   **Internal Self-Model:** EPET's emphasis on the predictive self-model provides a way to internalize and represent organismic goals and norms, which then guide the interpretation of interoceptive and exteroceptive information, including its affective significance. This offers a bridge between lower-level bodily regulation and higher-level narrative and existential concerns.

### Summary of EPET's Unique Position

EPET's distinctiveness arises from its specific synthesis:

*   It takes the **mechanistic power of PP** for explaining the generation of experiential content and regulatory signals.
*   It integrates **GWT** to explain conscious access, reportability, and the unity of experience.
*   It grounds these processes in **deep embodiment and interoception**, making bodily regulation central to affect.
*   It frames this within a consistent **non-reductive emergentist physicalism**, offering a constitutive account of qualia.
*   It incorporates a **dynamically plastic, Anattā-constrained predictive self-model** as a core modulator and interpreter of experience, particularly affective valence.

This combination allows EPET to address the phenomenality of valence, its conscious accessibility, its modulation by higher-level cognition and self-representation, and its grounding in biological viability, while aiming to avoid the pitfalls of strong reductionism, dualism, or pure functionalism. It positions itself as a philosophically informed scientific framework that seeks to bridge the gap between neural mechanisms and subjective affective experience.
