# Appendix C: The Predictive Self-Model and Affective Valence â€“ Empirical and Theoretical Support for Constitutive Modulation

This appendix provides a more detailed examination of the empirical evidence and theoretical arguments supporting EPET's claim (articulated in Section 2.4 of the main manuscript) that the predictive self-model plays a **constitutive role in shaping affective valence**, rather than merely influencing it post hoc. EPET posits that interoceptive prediction errors, while foundational for affect, acquire their full phenomenal character, intensity, and nuanced emotional quality through their integration and interpretation by the hierarchically organized predictive self-model.

## 1. Cognitive Reappraisal and Attribution: Altering Valence by Changing Meaning

A substantial body of research demonstrates that consciously changing the interpretation or meaning of a situation (cognitive reappraisal) or altering attributions about the cause of bodily arousal can profoundly change subjective affective experience and its physiological correlates.

*   **Reappraisal Studies:** Numerous studies show that instructing participants to reinterpret a negative stimulus (e.g., a distressing image) in a less negative or even positive way significantly reduces self-reported negative affect, diminishes amygdala activity, and modulates activity in prefrontal regions associated with cognitive control (e.g., dorsolateral and ventrolateral PFC) and self-referential processing (medial PFC) [@OchsnerGross2005; @Buhleetal2014].
    *   **EPET Interpretation:** Successful reappraisal involves the self-model generating new, high-level predictions (interpretations) about the stimulus or one's ability to cope. These top-down predictions alter the processing of bottom-up affective signals, changing their precision, their integration into the global workspace, and ultimately their constituted phenomenal valence. The feeling itself changes, not just the label applied to it.
*   **Misattribution of Arousal:** Classic studies (e.g., [@DuttonAron1974]) have shown that undifferentiated physiological arousal can be experienced as different emotions (e.g., fear vs. romantic attraction) depending on the context and the individual's causal attribution for that arousal.
    *   **EPET Interpretation:** The self-model generates a hypothesis about the cause of the interoceptive state (arousal). This hypothesis (e.g., "I am aroused because of the attractive person" vs. "I am aroused because of the dangerous bridge") frames the interpretation of the interoceptive prediction errors, leading to the constitution of different valenced experiences.
*   **Placebo and Nocebo Effects:** The powerful effects of placebos (positive expectations leading to improvement) and nocebos (negative expectations leading to worsening) on subjective experiences like pain and well-being are prime examples of self-model modulation. Beliefs and expectations, core components of the predictive self-model, directly shape the phenomenal experience of bodily states.
    *   **EPET Interpretation:** Placebo/nocebo effects involve the self-model generating strong priors about an upcoming interoceptive state. These priors modulate the processing of actual interoceptive signals (e.g., nociceptive prediction errors), altering their precision and integration, thereby changing the felt intensity and valence of pain or discomfort.

## 2. Neurobiology of Self-Referential Processing and Affect

Neuroimaging studies consistently reveal an overlap and strong interaction between brain networks involved in self-referential processing (notably the Default Mode Network - DMN, including mPFC, PCC, and angular gyrus) and those involved in affective and interoceptive processing (e.g., insula, ACC, amygdala).

*   **DMN-Affect Interaction:** Activity in DMN regions is often correlated with the intensity of self-relevant emotional experience, rumination on self-concerns (common in depression and anxiety), and the generation of self-conscious emotions [@Northoffetal2006; @WhitfieldGabrielietal2014].
    *   **EPET Interpretation:** The DMN is a key neural substrate for aspects of the predictive self-model, particularly its narrative and autobiographical components. Its interaction with affective/interoceptive regions reflects the continuous process by which the self-model interprets bodily states in relation to self-relevant goals, memories, and beliefs, thereby co-constituting the phenomenal character of emotions.
*   **Medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC):** The mPFC is crucial for self-reflection, evaluating the personal significance of stimuli, and emotion regulation. Its connectivity with limbic areas allows it to exert top-down control over affective responses.
    *   **EPET Interpretation:** The mPFC implements high-level predictive priors of the self-model that directly modulate the precision and interpretation of interoceptive prediction errors, thereby shaping valence.

## 3. Self-Conscious Emotions: Valence Constituted by Self-Evaluation

Emotions like pride, shame, guilt, and embarrassment are, by definition, self-conscious. Their valence and specific quality are inextricably linked to how an individual evaluates themselves, their actions, or their characteristics in relation to internalized standards, social norms, or personal goals.

*   **Evidence:** These emotions emerge later in development, coinciding with the maturation of self-representational capacities. They are universally associated with self-focused attention and activate brain regions involved in self-processing (mPFC, PCC, insula).
*   **EPET Interpretation:** Self-conscious emotions are prime examples of how the predictive self-model constitutes complex affective qualia.
    *   **Pride:** Positive valence arises from the self-model inferring a match between one's actions/attributes and valued standards, leading to a positive update of self-related predictions.
    *   **Shame/Guilt:** Negative valence arises from the self-model inferring a mismatch or violation, leading to negative updates and predictions of negative social consequences or threats to self-worth. The distinction between shame (global negative self-evaluation) and guilt (specific action-evaluation) reflects different levels or types of self-model inference.
    These emotions are not simply basic interoceptive signals plus a cognitive label; the self-evaluative inference is integral to the *way they feel*.

## 4. Clinical Conditions: Dysfunctional Self-Models and Altered Valence

Many psychiatric disorders are characterized by both disturbances in affective valence and maladaptive self-representations.

*   **Depression:** Often involves a negatively biased self-model (e.g., priors of worthlessness, hopelessness) that leads to persistent negative interpretation of interoceptive states (anhedonia, dysphoria) and exteroceptive events. Rumination, a DMN-driven process, reinforces these negative self-predictions.
*   **Anxiety Disorders:** Can involve a self-model characterized by priors of vulnerability and an over-assignment of precision to potential threat signals (both internal and external), leading to chronic negative valence.
*   **Personality Disorders (e.g., Narcissistic, Borderline):** Often feature unstable or distorted self-models that profoundly impact affective regulation and the interpretation of social and internal cues, leading to characteristic patterns of valenced experience.
*   **EPET Interpretation:** These conditions illustrate how the structure and dynamics of the predictive self-model are not epiphenomenal to affect but are deeply implicated in its constitution and regulation. Therapeutic approaches that target and modify maladaptive self-beliefs and narratives (e.g., CBT, schema therapy) can lead to significant changes in affective experience, consistent with EPET's view of the self-model's constitutive role.

## 5. Theoretical Arguments from Predictive Processing

Within the broader PP framework, the idea that high-level priors (including those constituting a self-model) shape lower-level processing is fundamental.

*   **Hierarchical Inference:** Predictions flow downwards from abstract (self-related) levels to more concrete (sensory/interoceptive) levels, while prediction errors flow upwards. This means that the self-model continuously influences how interoceptive signals are predicted, weighted (via precision), and interpreted.
*   **Active Inference and Goal-Directedness:** Organisms act to fulfill predictions related to their preferred states, which are often defined in relation to a self-model (e.g., maintaining self-integrity, achieving self-relevant goals). Affective valence, signaling progress towards or deviation from these goals, is thus intrinsically linked to the self-model's evaluative framework.

## Conclusion

The convergence of evidence from cognitive psychology (reappraisal, attribution), neurobiology (self-referential networks), developmental psychology (self-conscious emotions), clinical psychology (affective disorders), and theoretical neuroscience (PP/active inference) strongly supports EPET's proposal that the predictive self-model plays a crucial and **constitutive** role in modulating and differentiating affective valence. Raw interoceptive prediction errors provide a foundational substrate for affect, but it is their dynamic interaction with and interpretation by the multi-layered predictive self-model, within a globally accessible workspace, that gives rise to the rich, nuanced, and personally meaningful tapestry of human affective life.
