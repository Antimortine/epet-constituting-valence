# Appendix B: Detailed Testable Hypotheses Derived from EPET

This appendix elaborates on specific, empirically testable and potentially falsifiable hypotheses derived from the Emergentist-Predictive Experience Theory (EPET). These predictions stem from EPET's unique integration of Predictive Processing (PP), Global Workspace Theory (GWT), Embodiment/Interoception, its non-reductive emergentist physicalist stance, and the Anattā-constrained Self-Model. Testing these hypotheses is crucial for assessing the empirical viability and heuristic value of the EPET framework, particularly its claims regarding the constitution of affective valence and conscious experience.

## Hypothesis 1: Precision-Weighting Dissociates Phenomenal Intensity/Clarity of Qualia from Conscious Access Thresholds

*   **EPET Rationale:** EPET posits that the phenomenal intensity or clarity of qualia (including affective valence) is primarily constituted by dynamic characteristics of the underlying predictive model, such as signal stability, strength, and, crucially, assigned **precision** (as detailed in Section 2.2 of the main manuscript). In contrast, conscious access (leading to reportability and integration into broader cognition) depends on achieving global availability via GWT mechanisms (Section 2.5). While precision influences the likelihood of global access, EPET predicts that these two aspects—phenomenal intensity/clarity and the threshold for access/report—are partially dissociable. Manipulating precision should primarily affect subjective quality/vividness, potentially without proportionally altering objective reportability thresholds mediated by GWT ignition.
*   **Prediction:** In psychophysical tasks (e.g., near-threshold visual detection, attentional blink, somatosensory discrimination), experimentally manipulating attentional focus (top-down precision modulation) or neuromodulatory tone (e.g., via cholinergic agonists/antagonists influencing bottom-up precision) directed at a stimulus should modulate subjective ratings of its **vividness or clarity**. This modulation should occur even when objective detection accuracy (reportability) or ERP markers of global conscious access (e.g., P3b latency/amplitude, specific GNW ignition signatures) remain constant, change non-proportionally, or are deliberately held at threshold. For instance, a stimulus rendered highly precise through focused attention but presented too briefly for full GNW ignition might be reported as phenomenally vivid by subjects who nevertheless fail to report its identity or location accurately.
*   **Potential Methods:** Psychophysics (utilizing subjective rating scales for vividness/clarity alongside objective detection/discrimination tasks); EEG/MEG (to measure precision-related neural signals like alpha-band suppression or gamma-band power, and access-related signals like P3b or late fronto-parietal synchrony); pharmacological interventions or non-invasive brain stimulation (e.g., tDCS/TMS over parietal or prefrontal areas) to modulate precision or GWT dynamics.
*   **Falsification Conditions:** Subjective intensity/vividness ratings invariably and proportionally co-vary with objective measures of conscious access (reportability, P3b amplitude/latency) across all manipulations. It proves impossible to experimentally dissociate phenomenal intensity from the threshold of conscious report.

## Hypothesis 2: Interoceptive Prediction Error Dynamics Constitutively Shape Affective Valence Qualia

*   **EPET Rationale:** EPET proposes a specific constitutive account for core affective valence (the feeling tone of pleasantness/unpleasantness) as the phenomenal character of the system's ongoing evaluation of its interoceptive prediction errors relative to homeostatic/allostatic goals (Section 2.3). Successfully minimizing predicted interoceptive errors (or achieving a positive rate of error reduction) feels intrinsically positive; persistent or increasing errors feel intrinsically negative.
*   **Prediction:** Inducing unexpected, non-volitional interoceptive prediction errors (e.g., via unexpected changes in respiratory load, false physiological feedback such as inaccurate heart rate information, mild caloric vestibular stimulation affecting balance predictions, or subtle manipulations of core body temperature) should systematically bias the reported affective valence of concurrently presented, otherwise neutral, exteroceptive stimuli (e.g., images, sounds, tactile sensations). The magnitude and direction (positive/negative) of the valence shift should correlate with the inferred magnitude and sign (improvement vs. worsening relative to prediction) of the interoceptive prediction error. This effect should be specific to the valence dimension of affect, potentially occurring without impairing cognitive processing (e.g., recognition, categorization) of the neutral stimuli.
*   **Potential Methods:** Psychophysiology (continuous monitoring of ECG, respiration, EDA, core temperature); fMRI/EEG (focusing on activity in interoceptive cortices like the insula and ACC); false feedback paradigms; controlled environmental manipulations; psychophysical tasks involving valence rating scales for neutral stimuli presented during interoceptive challenges.
*   **Falsification Conditions:** Induced interoceptive prediction errors do not systematically alter affective valence ratings of neutral stimuli, or they only produce non-specific arousal effects (e.g., changes in alertness or general intensity of experience) without the predicted directional bias (positive/negative) on valence. Affective valence proves to be independent of the current state of interoceptive inference as manipulated.

## Hypothesis 3: Predictive Self-Model Disruption Selectively and Asymmetrically Alters Global Workspace Integration of Self-Relevant vs. Non-Self Content

*   **EPET Rationale:** EPET's self-model is a dynamic, hierarchically organized predictive construct, constrained by the Anattā principle (implying non-substantiality and plasticity), acting as a high-level prior in the PP hierarchy (Section 2.4). Perturbing this self-model (i.e., reducing its stability, coherence, or the precision of its core priors, e.g., via insight meditation, controlled psychedelic administration, or rTMS to key DMN nodes) should selectively and asymmetrically alter how self-related versus non-self-related information competes for and is integrated within the global workspace (GWT). Specifically, EPET predicts that reduced self-model precision should *decrease* the typically privileged access of self-relevant stimuli while potentially *increasing* the salience or phenomenal clarity of non-self stimuli due to released processing resources or a shift in attentional balance.
*   **Prediction:** Inducing states of "ego dissolution" or significant self-model perturbation (validated by subjective scales like the Ego Dissolution Inventory and neural markers like reduced DMN coherence or altered DMN-salience network connectivity) should lead to:
    *   (a) Reduced differential neural responses (e.g., P3b amplitude, fronto-parietal connectivity signatures) to self-relevant stimuli (e.g., participant's own name, face, or autobiographical memory cues) compared to equally salient but non-self-relevant stimuli.
    *   (b) Potentially enhanced subjective ratings of vividness, novelty, or intensity for concurrently presented non-self stimuli (exteroceptive or interoceptive).
    *   (c) Impaired performance on complex tasks requiring stable, integrated self-representation (e.g., nuanced social perspective-taking, coherent autobiographical narration, judgments of personality traits).
*   **Potential Methods:** EEG/fMRI during self-referential tasks (e.g., own vs. other face/name recognition, trait judgments, autobiographical recall); validated ASC induction protocols (e.g., mindfulness/Vipassanā meditation, controlled psychedelic administration); subjective report questionnaires (EDI, 5D-ASC); behavioral tasks targeting self-representation and social cognition; rTMS targeting DMN hubs (e.g., mPFC, PCC).
*   **Falsification Conditions:** States of ego dissolution affect global processing non-selectively (e.g., a general reduction in attention or P3b amplitude for all stimuli equally), or self-relevant stimuli retain their typically privileged access despite subjective reports and neural markers of self-model disruption. No evidence for the predicted asymmetry in processing self vs. non-self content is found.


**Concluding Note on Hypotheses:**
These hypotheses are designed to probe the core integrative claims of EPET, where the interaction between its constituent components (PP, GWT, Embodiment, Self-Model) leads to predictions not easily derivable from those components in isolation. Successful empirical support for these (and similar) hypotheses would lend significant credence to EPET's unique theoretical synthesis and its potential to advance our understanding of consciousness and affective valence. Conversely, consistent falsification would necessitate significant revision or rejection of the theory's central tenets.
