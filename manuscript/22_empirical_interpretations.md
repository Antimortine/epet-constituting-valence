## Interpreting Empirical Evidence through the Lens of EPET

While the Emergentist-Predictive Experience Theory (EPET) is primarily a philosophical and theoretical framework, its plausibility and explanatory power are enhanced by its ability to coherently interpret a wide range of empirical findings from neuroscience, psychology, and psychopathology. This section does not aim to provide exhaustive proof, but rather to illustrate how EPET's core tenets—particularly the constitutive role of embodied predictive regulation, self-model modulation, and global workspace access in shaping affective valence—can make sense of existing data.

### Neurobiology of Interoception and Affective Valence

Recent neurobiological research consistently highlights the crucial role of interoceptive processing in affective experience, with key brain regions such as the **insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)** being central.

*   **EPET's Interpretation:** EPET views these findings as direct support for its emphasis on interoception as the bedrock of valence (Section 2.3).
    *   Activity in the **insula**, particularly the anterior insula, is interpreted within EPET not merely as a correlate of bodily awareness, but as a hub where interoceptive prediction errors are integrated, precision-weighted, and potentially constituted as valenced feeling tones when broadcast globally [@Craig2009how; @GuHofFristonFan2013]. The insula's role in processing deviations from predicted homeostatic states aligns with EPET's view of valence as reflecting regulatory success or failure.
    *   The **ACC** is seen as crucial for evaluating the significance of these interoceptive prediction errors, particularly in relation to current goals and potential behavioral responses, contributing to the intensity and motivational aspect often associated with (though distinct from) valence.
    *   The slow, convergent nature of interoceptive pathways, terminating in these limbic and paralimbic structures, helps explain the often diffuse, embodied, and subjectively "felt" quality of valence, as proposed by EPET.

### Psychopathology: Anxiety, Depression, and Anhedonia

Many psychiatric conditions involve profound disturbances in affective experience.

*   **EPET's Interpretation:**
    *   **Anxiety Disorders:** EPET can frame anxiety as arising from maladaptive predictive models that assign excessively **high precision to ambiguous or potentially threatening interoceptive (or exteroceptive) signals** (Section 2.2). This leads to persistent negative valence (the "feeling" of threat or unease) even in the absence of objective danger, as the system over-interprets bodily arousal or environmental cues as signs of impending harm [@PaulusFeinstein2019]. The self-model in anxiety might also incorporate priors of vulnerability, further amplifying negative affect.
    *   **Depression and Anhedonia:** Depression, characterized by persistent low mood and anhedonia (reduced capacity to experience pleasure), can be interpreted in EPET as a state of **dysfunctional predictive regulation**. This might involve:
        *   Rigid, pessimistic priors within the self-model that consistently interpret interoceptive and exteroceptive information negatively, biasing valence generation.
        *   A failure to generate or update predictions of positive outcomes, leading to a blunted response to potentially rewarding stimuli (anhedonia). This could relate to impaired dynamics of prediction error reduction (a core component of positive valence in EPET).
        *   Altered precision-weighting, perhaps dampening the impact of positive prediction errors or over-weighting negative ones.
    *   **Alexithymia:** Difficulty identifying and describing one's own emotions can be understood in EPET as a potential disruption in the integration of interoceptive signals with the self-model or a failure of these valenced states to achieve robust global broadcast and conceptualization. The raw bodily component of affect might be present, but its transformation into a consciously recognized and reportable emotion is impaired.

### Cognitive Modulation of Affect: Reappraisal and Placebo Effects

The significant impact of cognitive strategies on emotional experience provides strong support for EPET's emphasis on the self-model's modulatory role.

*   **EPET's Interpretation:**
    *   **Cognitive Reappraisal:** When individuals successfully reappraise a negative situation in a more positive or neutral light, EPET suggests this involves the **top-down modulation of lower-level affective processing by the predictive self-model** (Section 2.4). The self-model introduces new high-level predictions (interpretations, goals) that alter the meaning and consequently the precision and affective impact of incoming sensory and interoceptive signals. This changes the overall configuration of the predictive process, thereby constitutively altering the felt valence.
    *   **Placebo Analgesia:** The reduction of pain perception through placebo administration is interpreted by EPET as a powerful demonstration of how expectations (priors) generated by the self-model (e.g., "this treatment will work") can directly modulate the processing of nociceptive prediction errors, reducing their assigned precision or altering their integration, leading to a genuine change in the phenomenal experience of pain.

### Altered States of Consciousness (ASCs): Psychedelics and Meditation

Experiences during ASCs, such as ego dissolution reported with psychedelics or profound states in meditation, offer insights into the plasticity of self-representation and affect.

*   **EPET's Interpretation:**
    *   **Ego Dissolution:** EPET interprets ego dissolution as a significant alteration or even temporary suspension of the normal functioning of the **predictive self-model** (Section 3.2 of the main manuscript, if this refers to a different paper, or elaborate here). This could be due to a profound shift in the precision assigned to self-related priors (e.g., psychedelics "relaxing" high-level priors [@CarhartHarrisFriston2014]). The resulting phenomenological changes—blurred self-other boundaries, altered affective tone—are seen as direct consequences of this disruption in the self-modeling process and its influence on global workspace dynamics.
    *   **Meditative States:** Certain meditative practices aim to deconstruct habitual patterns of self-identification and reactivity. Within EPET, this can be understood as training the system to:
        *   Reduce the precision of self-related narrative priors.
        *   Increase interoceptive awareness (precision of raw bodily signals) while decoupling it from habitual affective interpretations generated by the self-model.
        *   This can lead to a shift in baseline affective valence and a different way of experiencing bodily sensations, consistent with reports of equanimity or altered feeling tones.

### Conclusion: Consilience and Explanatory Scope

EPET's integrative framework, by combining PP, GWT, embodiment, and a specific emergentist philosophy with a constrained self-model, demonstrates considerable consilience with a diverse array of empirical findings. It offers a way to understand not just *that* these phenomena occur, but *how* they might be realized through the interplay of predictive regulation, self-representation, and conscious access mechanisms. This capacity to provide a coherent, architecturally grounded interpretation of existing data, particularly concerning the nuanced interplay between body, self, and affective feeling, underscores EPET's potential as a fruitful theory for future research. The true test, however, will lie in its ability to generate novel, falsifiable predictions (see Section 4.2 and Supplementary Materials C).
