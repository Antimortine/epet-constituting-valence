# The Philosophical Argument for a Constitutive Account of Valence

A central philosophical commitment of the Emergentist-Predictive Experience Theory (EPET) is its **constitutive explanation of affective valence**. This contrasts with more common causal or correlational accounts, which often view valence as an output *produced by* or merely *associated with* certain neural or cognitive processes. EPET, instead, argues that affective valence—the phenomenal quality of pleasantness or unpleasantness—*is* an intrinsic, high-level property of a specific kind of organized, dynamic, embodied predictive process. This section outlines the philosophical rationale supporting this constitutive stance, drawing upon principles of emergentism and addressing common intuitions about the mind-body problem as it pertains to affect.

### Reframing the Explanatory Task: From Causal Generation to Constitutive Realization

Traditional approaches to valence often implicitly or explicitly seek a *causal* mechanism: what neural process X *causes* or *generates* the feeling of Y (e.g., pleasure)? This framing can lead to the "explanatory gap" intuition—it seems mysterious how purely physical processes could *give rise to* something as seemingly non-physical as a subjective feeling [@Levine1983].

EPET reframes the question. Instead of asking "What *causes* valence?", it asks: "**What kind of organizational and dynamic properties must a physical system possess such that its ongoing activity *constitutes* or *is* an instance of affective valence?**" This is analogous to asking not what causes liquidity in H₂O, but rather what arrangement and dynamics of H₂O molecules *constitute* the state of being liquid. Liquidity is not something *added to* the molecules; it *is* a high-level description of their collective behavior under certain conditions.

Similarly, EPET proposes that affective valence is not a separate entity or signal produced by the predictive regulation of interoception. Rather, **valence is what it is like, from the system's intrinsic perspective, to be engaged in that specific mode of embodied, predictive self-regulation** when that process meets certain criteria of complexity, integration, precision-weighting, self-model modulation, and global accessibility (as detailed in Chapter 2).

### Weak Emergentism and Non-Reductive Physicalism as a Foundation

EPET’s constitutive claim is grounded in **weak (or epistemic) emergentist physicalism** (see Section 2.2 of the main manuscript for EPET's metaphysical foundations, if this refers to a different paper, or elaborate here if this is the first mention of the metaphysical section). This philosophical stance holds that:

1.  **Ontological Physicalism:** All that exists is physical, or realized by the physical. There are no non-physical substances or fundamental properties.
2.  **Emergence of Novel Properties:** Complex physical systems can exhibit genuinely novel properties and behaviors at higher levels of organization that are not straightforwardly reducible to, nor simply aggregative of, the properties of their individual components. These emergent properties depend on the specific organization and dynamic interactions of the components.
3.  **Constitutive Identity:** These novel, system-level emergent properties are *constituted by* (or are identical to) the organized lower-level physical processes. They are not *caused by* them in the sense of being distinct effects.

Affective valence, in EPET, is considered such an emergent, system-level property of the integrated predictive architecture. The specific "feel" of pleasure or pain is the intrinsic character of the system operating in a particular globally accessible, self-regulatory configuration.

### The "Nothing Extra" Principle and Avoiding Dualistic Intuitions

The constitutive view adheres to a "nothing extra" principle. Once the necessary and sufficient physical organization and dynamics are in place—the complex, embodied, predictive self-regulatory process operating in a globally accessible manner—affective valence is thereby realized. No additional, non-physical "feeling stuff" or "valence quale" needs to be generated or infused into the system.

The intuition that there *must* be something extra often stems from:

*   **Category Mistakes:** Applying causal explanatory frameworks where constitutive ones are appropriate.
*   **Implicit Dualism:** Assuming that subjective qualities must be of a fundamentally different kind than physical processes, thus requiring a "generation" step across an ontological divide.
*   **The Nature of Phenomenal Concepts:** Our first-person concepts of affective states are different in kind from our third-person, theoretical concepts of neural processes, creating an epistemic gap that can be mistaken for an ontological one (as discussed with the Phenomenal Concept Strategy, e.g., [@Balog2020; @DiazLeon2020]).

EPET argues that the subjective, first-person "feel" of valence is the intrinsic way the system itself experiences its own highly organized, goal-directed, interoceptive regulatory activity when that activity is globally broadcast and integrated with the self-model. It is not an observation of that activity by some inner homunculus, nor a separate signal produced by it, but the very mode of that activity's unfolding from the system's integrated perspective.

### Addressing the "Why This Process?" Question

A potential objection to a constitutive account is: "Why *this specific* kind of physical process (integrated, embodied predictive regulation) and not some other?" EPET's answer lies in the unique functional and organizational characteristics of this process:

1.  **Intrinsic Relation to Viability:** Interoceptive predictive regulation is fundamentally about maintaining the organism's viability and well-being. Errors in this domain have direct, existential consequences. This inherent link to survival and flourishing provides a naturalistic basis for the "goodness" or "badness" aspect of valence.
2.  **Embodied and Self-Referential Nature:** The process is intrinsically embodied and self-referential—it is the system modeling and regulating *itself*. This provides the basis for the subjective, first-person character of the experience.
3.  **Integration and Global Accessibility:** The involvement of GWT mechanisms ensures that the valenced state is not merely a local computation but an integrated, globally available state that can inform the entire cognitive system, giving it a unified phenomenal presence.
4.  **Dynamic and Modulatory Complexity:** The hierarchical structure, precision-weighting, and modulation by a sophisticated self-model allow for the rich, graded, and context-sensitive nature of affective experience.

It is this specific constellation of features—its direct link to organismic integrity, its embodied self-referentiality, its global integration, and its dynamic complexity—that makes this particular kind of emergent process a candidate for constituting what we experience as affective valence. Other physical processes, lacking this specific organization and functional role, would not constitute valence, just as a random collection of H₂O molecules does not constitute liquidity.

### Conclusion: Plausibility of a Constitutive Stance

By adopting a constitutive stance grounded in weak emergentism, EPET aims to naturalize affective valence without eliminating its subjective reality. It shifts the explanatory burden from finding a mysterious causal link between brain and feeling to detailing the specific organizational and dynamic properties of the brain-body system that *are* affective experience. This approach, while not claiming to dispel all intuitive wonder surrounding subjectivity, offers a philosophically coherent and scientifically tractable path towards understanding why and how certain complex physical processes feel the way they do from the first-person perspective. The subsequent sections will further compare this approach with alternatives and explore its empirical implications.
