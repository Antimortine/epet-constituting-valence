## Modulation of Valence by the Predictive Self-Model

While affective valence is fundamentally grounded in the embodied, predictive regulation of interoceptive states (as argued in Section 2.3), EPET proposes that **the final phenomenal character, interpretation, and behavioral implications of this valence are deeply shaped and modulated by the predictive self-model**. This self-model is not a static entity but a dynamic, hierarchically organized, and continuously updated set of predictions and inferences about “who I am,” “what my state is,” and “what my goals are” in relation to the world [@Metzinger2004being; @Hohwy2013predictive; @Kopnin2025]. It provides both the **frame of reference** and the **attributional and evaluative structure** within which raw bodily feelings acquire nuanced emotional meaning and motivational significance.

EPET integrates insights from phenomenology, cognitive neuroscience (particularly regarding self-referential processing and emotion regulation), and aspects of Buddhist psychology (notably the concept of *saṅkhāra*—volitional formations, mental constructions, or dispositions that shape perception and experience) into a unified architectural account. The core idea is that **foundational interoceptive affect is transformed into complex, context-rich emotion through its interaction with and modulation by the predictive self-model.**

### Attribution and Interpretation of Affective Signals

The predictive self-model plays a crucial role in assigning **causal and emotional meaning** to often ambiguous interoceptive inputs. The same pattern of physiological arousal (e.g., a racing heart, increased respiration) can be interpreted—and therefore experienced—differently depending on the active predictions generated by the self-model in a given context. For instance:

*   A racing heart could be attributed to **external danger** (leading to the experience of fear), **exciting positive anticipation** (joy or thrill), **physical exertion** (neutral or even positive if goal-related), or **an internal medical issue** (anxiety or concern).
*   The same underlying interoceptive prediction error, signaling a deviation from a predicted bodily state, **can thus contribute to distinct emotional valences and qualities** depending on the self-model’s current best hypothesis about its cause and significance.

EPET posits that:

> **This attribution and interpretation within the self-model is not merely a post hoc cognitive labeling of a pre-existing feeling, but a constitutive element in how the system *experiences* the bodily state affectively.**

This aligns with classic experimental findings in misattribution-of-arousal paradigms (e.g., [@DuttonAron1974]) and studies on the cognitive modulation of pain, where beliefs and contextual framing radically alter reported valence and even physiological responses. Within EPET, such shifts occur because **the self-model actively reshapes the inference landscape**—modulating the precision, integration, and subsequent global broadcast of interoceptive prediction errors. The self-model influences not only the interpretation of affective signals but also their priority for conscious access via mechanisms of attention and expected relevance.

### Goal-Directed Contextualization and Valence Reframing

The predictive self-model also encodes the organism’s **goals, values, norms, and narrative identity**. This high-level predictive structure enables powerful **top-down contextualization and reinterpretation of affective states**, which can significantly alter their felt valence:

*   Muscle ache experienced during rest might be negatively valenced; the same ache experienced after a strenuous workout aligned with fitness goals can be positively valenced (interpreted as a sign of "good work" or progress).
*   Pain endured during a meaningful ritual, a therapeutic process, or in service of a valued cause can be reframed as significant, tolerable, or even transformative, rather than purely aversive.

EPET frames this as a form of **narrative-level modulation or override**: a sufficiently strong and coherent self-model, with its embedded goals and narratives, can **transform the phenomenal character of raw affect into a more structured and meaningful emotion** via top-down predictive influences. Cognitive reappraisal strategies, which involve consciously changing the meaning of an emotional stimulus or situation, are a prime example. Successful reappraisal has been shown to reduce negative valence, alter physiological responses, and recruit prefrontal cortical regions involved in cognitive control and self-regulation, supporting the claim that the self-model **constitutively modulates affect**, not merely reacts to it.

### Precision Regulation by the Self-Model

As discussed in Section 2.2, **precision-weighting of prediction errors is crucial for determining their affective salience and intensity**. EPET further argues that:

> **The predictive self-model is a key source of top-down control over the precision assigned to interoceptive (and other) prediction errors.**

Beliefs about oneself, one's capabilities, and the nature of one's experiences directly influence how strongly bodily deviations are weighted and, consequently, how intensely they are felt:

*   A self-model characterized by perceived vulnerability or a history of trauma (e.g., in PTSD) may lead to the assignment of **excessive precision** to ambiguous or minor interoceptive errors, amplifying their negative affective impact and contributing to hypervigilance or anxiety.
*   Conversely, a self-model incorporating beliefs about resilience, or a state cultivated through practices like mindfulness meditation, may facilitate the **down-regulation of precision** for certain aversive signals, leading to greater emotional equanimity or a detached observation of bodily discomfort.

This dynamic tuning of precision by the self-model can help explain a wide range of phenomena, from the **hyper-sensitivity in anxiety disorders** (interoceptive precision pathologically amplified) and the **emotional blunting in depersonalization** (interoceptive precision potentially suppressed or decoupled) to the **altered states of consciousness** reported in deep meditation or under the influence of psychedelics, where the typical functioning of the self-model and its precision-regulation capacities are profoundly modified [@DeaneMillerWilkinson2020].

### Construction of Self-Conscious Emotions

Emotions such as shame, guilt, pride, embarrassment, and moral satisfaction are **inherently self-referential**. They arise from **evaluating one’s own actions, traits, or social standing** against internalized standards, goals, or social norms. EPET interprets these complex affective states as:

> **Temporally extended, high-level interoceptive-affective states, whose specific valence and quality are constitutively shaped and differentiated by inferences made at the narrative and social layers of the predictive self-model.**

These emotions involve **recursive inference** where the self is both the agent and the object of evaluation:

*   **Shame** might involve negative interoceptive valence combined with a global negative self-attribution ("I am bad/flawed") and predicted social rejection.
*   **Guilt** might involve similar negative valence but with an action-focused attribution ("I did something wrong") and a motivation for repair.
*   **Pride** typically involves positive valence linked to a self-attribution of success or valued characteristics, aligned with personal or social goals.

Neuroimaging studies consistently show activation of brain regions associated with self-referential processing (e.g., medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex) and interoceptive/affective processing (e.g., insula, ACC) during the experience of such self-conscious emotions, supporting their integrated nature within the EPET framework.

### Global Broadcast and Narrative Dominance

Interpretations of bodily states that are highly relevant to the self-model—especially those involving core aspects of identity, deeply held beliefs, or pressing goals—are likely to gain **priority in the competition for conscious access and global broadcast** via GWT mechanisms. EPET emphasizes that:

> **The narrative layers of the predictive self-model can act as powerful filters and amplifiers for what interoceptive information becomes globally available and how it is affectively colored in conscious experience.**

Thus, even physiologically ambiguous or relatively neutral bodily signals can acquire strong positive or negative valence when **interpreted through a dominant self-narrative** (e.g., a slight fatigue interpreted as "I am failing again" versus "I am healthily tired after productive work").

### Summary: Valence as Self-Modeled, Embodied Affect

In EPET, the journey from raw interoceptive prediction error to a fully-fledged, consciously experienced emotion is one where valence is **not simply computed from bodily signals alone**. Instead, it is **dynamically inferred, weighted, contextualized, and often transformed** through its interaction with a multi-layered predictive self-model that is temporally extended, context-sensitive, and dynamically plastic. This integration allows for:

*   The reinterpretation of basic bodily states in light of personal goals, values, and narrative identity.
*   The modulation of emotional salience and intensity through self-directed precision control.
*   The emergence of complex, uniquely human emotions from the interplay of core interoceptive-affective signals and sophisticated self-representational capacities.

The next section will turn to the final architectural component in EPET’s account of conscious valence: how these self-modeled, embodied affective states become part of the unified conscious scene via **global broadcasting mechanisms**.
