## The Role of Predictive Hierarchy and Precision in Shaping Valence

While EPET’s core hypothesis identifies valence as a constitutive feature of embodied predictive regulation, its specific phenomenal quality and intensity are further shaped by two crucial, interrelated factors within the Predictive Processing (PP) architecture: **(1) the hierarchical organization** of interoceptive inference and **(2) the dynamic modulation of precision** assigned to prediction errors within that hierarchy. This section elaborates on how these components contribute to the constitution and experience of affective valence.

### Hierarchical Organization of Interoceptive Modeling

The predictive brain is understood to be organized into a multilevel hierarchy, where higher levels generate more abstract, temporally extended predictions about the causes of sensory input, while lower levels deal with more granular, modality-specific details [@Friston2010; @Clark2013whatever]. This hierarchical principle applies robustly to interoception: signals from specific physiological systems (e.g., cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal) are progressively integrated into **higher-order models** that estimate global bodily condition, energetic resources, potential homeostatic/allostatic imbalances, and overall alignment with the organism's long-term goals and viability.

EPET proposes that **affective valence itself is hierarchically structured**, reflecting the contribution of different layers of the predictive system to the construction of the overall affective tone:

*   **Low-level valence** can emerge from **high-precision, modality-specific interoceptive prediction errors** that signal localized deviations from physiological setpoints (e.g., the sharp unpleasantness of acute pain, the distinct discomfort of hunger or thirst). These often correspond to immediate threats or needs.
*   **High-level valence** can reflect the **emergent coherence or dissonance** between abstract self-models, narrative goals, social evaluations, and the ongoing stream of integrated interoceptive states. This can result in more diffuse but often more motivationally and existentially potent affective experiences, such as feelings of vitality, anxiety, despair, contentment, or "gut feelings" about complex situations.

Furthermore, the hierarchical structure allows for **top-down predictions from higher levels to modulate the interpretation and affective impact** of lower-level interoceptive errors. For instance, the same nociceptive signal (a low-level prediction error) might be experienced with less negative valence if a higher-level model predicts it as a sign of muscle recovery after exercise ("this ache is a sign of progress") versus a sign of illness ("this ache signals something is wrong"). In this view, the *felt quality of valence* is constituted not only by the content of bodily error signals but also by the **interpretive structure** provided by the entire predictive hierarchy into which those signals are integrated.

### Precision Modulation and the Salience of Affect

Within PP, the influence of a prediction error is determined not just by its magnitude but also by its assigned **precision**—an estimate of the signal’s reliability, certainty, or context-dependent salience [@FeldmanFriston2010; @Hohwy2013predictive]. Precision effectively gates the flow of information, determining which prediction errors are prioritized for updating generative models and for gaining access to conscious processing and behavioral control.

EPET builds on this by proposing that:

> **The felt intensity, salience, and even the specific character of affective valence are constitutively shaped by the precision-weighting of interoceptive prediction errors at various levels of the hierarchy.**

A **high-precision interoceptive prediction error** is more likely to:

*   Become **consciously felt** and reportable.
*   Become **attentionally dominant**, capturing cognitive resources.
*   Be experienced with **greater emotional intensity** (e.g., the overwhelming nature of panic, the sharpness of acute pain, or the vividness of blissful relief).

Conversely, a **low-precision error**, even if substantial in magnitude, might result in a vague mood, a diffuse sense of discomfort, or remain largely below the threshold of conscious awareness.

Illustrative examples include:

*   **Anxiety and hypervigilance:** These states can be understood as involving a **chronic over-assignment of precision** to potentially threat-related (or ambiguous) bodily cues, leading to persistent negative valence even in the absence of objective external danger [@PaulusFeinstein2019].
*   **Mindfulness and interoceptive attention:** Practices that cultivate interoceptive attention may increase the precision assigned to subtle bodily signals, sometimes intensifying the experience of both positive and negative background affective states, but also potentially allowing for their re-contextualization [@Hesp2021].
*   **Dissociation or anosognosia:** Certain conditions might involve a pathological **down-regulation of precision** for specific interoceptive signals, effectively shielding the system from overwhelming negative affect, but at the cost of accurate self-perception.

In essence, **precision transforms raw interoceptive prediction errors from mere background physiological fluctuations into affectively significant events** that demand attention and guide behavior.

### Precision as a Mediator Between Self-Model, Context, and Affect

EPET also emphasizes that **precision is not assigned in a vacuum**; its allocation is dynamically regulated by multiple factors, including:

*   **Contextual expectations:** The current environment and task demands influence which bodily signals are deemed relevant.
*   **Attentional focus:** Directing attention towards or away from bodily sensations modulates their precision.
*   **The predictive self-model:** Crucially, higher-level beliefs about one’s identity, resilience, vulnerability, or current goals significantly influence **how interoceptive deviations are weighted and interpreted**. For example, a self-model that predicts fragility might assign high precision to minor bodily discomforts, amplifying negative affect. Conversely, a self-model predicting resilience might down-weight the same signals, attenuating their affective impact. This aligns with findings in trauma, chronic pain, and depression, where maladaptive self-beliefs can perpetuate negative affective loops by amplifying the perceived threat or significance of somatic states [@Hesp2021; @Solms2019].

### Summary: Hierarchically Shaped, Precision-Tuned Valence

Taken together, EPET proposes that affective valence:

*   Emerges within a **deep predictive hierarchy** that integrates signals from the most basic physiological level up to complex narrative self-representations.
*   Is **dynamically shaped, scaled, and intensified** by the context-sensitive assignment of precision to interoceptive prediction errors at all levels of this hierarchy.
*   Becomes **phenomenally salient and consciously experienced** when these precision-weighted, hierarchically integrated signals are interpreted through the lens of the self-model and made globally available for cognitive processing.

Valence, therefore, is not merely *registered* by the brain—it is actively *enacted, weighted, and contextualized* within the organism’s ongoing, embodied attempt to model and regulate itself as a viable agent in a complex world. This hierarchical-precision perspective also allows for the rich tapestry of affective life, where valence can be gradated, layered, and mixed, reflecting the complex interplay of signals arising and competing within the predictive architecture. The next section will further explore the embodied grounding of these processes.
