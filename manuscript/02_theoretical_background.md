## Contemporary Predictive Processing Accounts of Valence

Recent advancements in understanding affective valence are increasingly rooted in Predictive Processing (PP) and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) frameworks. These approaches generally posit that valence is not a standalone mental state but rather an emergent property or a direct reflection of the organism's ongoing success in predictively regulating its internal bodily (interoceptive) states in relation to homeostatic and allostatic goals [@Seth2013; @Barrett2017]. Affective valence, from this perspective, signals the brain's assessment of how well its predictive models are managing the body's physiological integrity and navigating the environment.

Several key mechanistic proposals have emerged within this overarching view:

1.  **Valence as Prediction Error or Free Energy Dynamics:** A prominent line of thought formalizes valence in terms of the temporal dynamics of prediction error or its information-theoretic correlate, free energy.
    *   It has been proposed that emotional valence corresponds to the rate of change of free energy (or surprise) over time: a decrease in free energy (i.e., prediction errors are being successfully minimized) is experienced as positive valence, while an increase signifies negative valence [@JoffilyCoricelli2013]. This links affect to the learning process, where valence signals the current efficacy of the predictive model.
    *   Relatedly, valence has been associated with changes in expected uncertainty [@Solms2019] or the anticipated rate of prediction error reduction [@FernandezVelascoLoev2021]. Positive affect may arise when prediction errors diminish faster than expected, or when the system anticipates successful error reduction, highlighting the role of second-order predictions about model performance [@VandeCruys2017].

2.  **Valence as Precision or Model Confidence:** Another set of theories emphasizes the role of precision—the estimated reliability or salience of prediction errors—or the overall confidence in the generative model.
    *   Valence might be conceptualized as the inferred confidence an agent has in its current predictive model's ability to maintain bodily well-being, termed "subjective fitness" [@Hesp2021]. Here, affect is deeply tied to the agent's assessment of its own regulatory competence.
    *   The precision assigned to interoceptive prediction errors themselves is also considered crucial. High-precision signals indicating homeostatic balance could constitute positive valence, while high-precision errors signaling deviation might constitute negative valence, directly influencing the intensity and conscious availability of the affective experience [@NikolovaVuorreetal2022].

3.  **Interoceptive Inference as a Foundation:** Many models ground valence in the continuous process of interoceptive inference—the brain's modeling and prediction of internal bodily states.
    *   "Core affect," a basic, continuous stream of pleasant/unpleasant and arousing/calm feelings, is often seen as a low-dimensional summary of the body's current physiological state, or "body budget" [@Barrett2017]. Valence, in this view, reflects whether current interoceptive predictions signal a move towards or away from allostatic balance.
    *   Successful active inference over visceral states, where the system effectively anticipates and meets bodily needs, is thought to generate positive valence, while persistent, unmitigated interoceptive prediction errors are linked to negative affective states [@Seth2013; @SmithBadcockFriston2022neurobiology].

These predictive accounts offer a powerful, unifying framework for understanding the generation and function of affective valence, linking it directly to the organism's fundamental imperative to maintain viability through predictive regulation. However, as will be discussed, they also face conceptual and philosophical challenges, particularly concerning the subjective quality of valence and its precise relationship with consciousness.
