# Empirical Hypotheses Derived from EPET for Future Research

A key strength of the Emergentist-Predictive Experience Theory (EPET) lies in its capacity to generate specific, empirically testable hypotheses that bridge its philosophical claims with potential experimental investigation. Testing these predictions is crucial for evaluating the coherence, explanatory power, and heuristic value of the integrated framework. The following hypotheses, while not exhaustive, highlight some core predictions arising from EPET's unique synthesis of Predictive Processing (PP), Global Workspace Theory (GWT), Embodiment/Interoception, and its Anattā-constrained Self-Model, particularly concerning the constitution of affective valence. (More detailed operationalizations can be found in Supplementary Materials C).

### Hypothesis 1: Precision-Weighting Dissociates Qualia Intensity from Conscious Access

*   **Rationale (EPET):** EPET posits that phenomenal intensity/clarity of qualia (including affective valence) is primarily constituted by PP-level dynamics like signal stability and assigned precision (Section 2.2), whereas conscious access (reportability, integration) depends on GWT mechanisms (Section 2.5). While precision influences global access likelihood, these aspects should be partially dissociable.
*   **Prediction:** Manipulating attentional focus (top-down precision) or neuromodulatory tone (bottom-up precision) directed at a stimulus should modulate subjective ratings of its vividness/clarity, even when objective detection accuracy or ERP markers of global access (e.g., P3b amplitude/latency) remain constant or change non-proportionally. For instance, a highly attended but brief (and thus perhaps not fully broadcast) stimulus might be rated as phenomenally vivid.
*   **Potential Falsification:** Subjective intensity/vividness ratings always co-vary perfectly and proportionally with objective measures of conscious access.

### Hypothesis 2: Interoceptive Prediction Errors Directly Shape Affective Valence Qualia

*   **Rationale (EPET):** EPET proposes a constitutive account for core affective valence as the phenomenal character of ongoing interoceptive prediction error evaluation relative to homeostatic/allostatic goals (Section 2.3).
*   **Prediction:** Inducing unexpected, non-volitional interoceptive prediction errors (e.g., via false physiological feedback, unexpected respiratory load) should systematically bias the reported affective valence of concurrently presented neutral stimuli. The magnitude and direction (positive/negative) of this valence shift should correlate with the inferred magnitude and sign of the interoceptive prediction error. This effect should be specific to valence, potentially without impairing cognitive processing of the neutral stimuli.
*   **Potential Falsification:** Induced interoceptive prediction errors do not systematically alter affective valence ratings of neutral stimuli, or only produce non-specific arousal effects.

### Hypothesis 3: Self-Model Disruption Selectively Alters Global Workspace Integration of Self-Relevant Content

*   **Rationale (EPET):** EPET's Anattā-constrained self-model is a dynamic, high-level prior within the PP hierarchy (Section 2.4). Perturbing this self-model (e.g., via meditation, psychedelics, or TMS to DMN nodes) should selectively alter how self-related information competes for and is integrated within the GWT. An asymmetric effect is predicted: reduced self-model precision should decrease privileged access for self-relevant stimuli and potentially increase salience for non-self stimuli.
*   **Prediction:** Inducing "ego dissolution" or self-model perturbation should lead to: (a) reduced neural responses (e.g., P3b) specifically to self-relevant stimuli (e.g., own name/face) compared to other salient stimuli; (b) potentially enhanced subjective vividness for non-self stimuli during perturbation; (c) impaired performance on tasks requiring stable self-representation.
*   **Potential Falsification:** Ego dissolution states affect global processing non-selectively, or self-relevant stimuli retain privileged access despite self-model disruption.

### Hypothesis 4: Embodied Predictive Congruence Amplifies Perceptual Qualia Precision

*   **Rationale (EPET):** EPET emphasizes embodiment, suggesting that congruent multisensory and proprioceptive/interoceptive signals enhance the precision of the overall perceptual hypothesis, leading to greater phenomenal intensity/clarity (Section 2.2, 2.3).
*   **Prediction:** In paradigms manipulating multisensory bodily congruence (e.g., rubber hand illusion, VR body-swapping), high congruence conditions (e.g., synchronous stroking) should result in higher subjective ratings of perceptual vividness/clarity for the relevant modality compared to low congruence, even if low-level sensory input is matched. This should correlate with neural markers of increased precision.
*   **Potential Falsification:** Subjective perceptual clarity is unaffected by bodily congruence, or changes are solely attributable to attentional capture.

### Hypothesis 5: Homeostatic State Gates Global Conscious Access Threshold

*   **Rationale (EPET):** As an embodied theory linked to FEP, EPET views consciousness as serving adaptive regulation. Pressing homeostatic needs (signaled by high-precision interoceptive errors) should prioritize internal regulation, potentially by raising the threshold for non-urgent external information to access GWT (Section 2.5).
*   **Prediction:** Inducing mild homeostatic challenges (e.g., thirst, hunger) should increase the perceptual threshold for detecting/reporting unrelated, near-threshold external stimuli compared to a sated baseline. This effect should be specific to conscious access (e.g., affecting P3b), potentially leaving pre-conscious processing (e.g., N1/P2) unaffected.
*   **Potential Falsification:** Mild homeostatic challenges have no effect on conscious access thresholds for unrelated stimuli, or only induce non-specific general slowing/arousal effects.

These hypotheses represent starting points for empirically probing EPET's integrative claims. Their investigation, leveraging methods from psychophysics, neuroimaging (EEG/fMRI), pharmacology, and computational modeling, can help refine the theory and deepen our understanding of the complex interplay between prediction, embodiment, self-representation, conscious access, and the constitution of affective experience.
