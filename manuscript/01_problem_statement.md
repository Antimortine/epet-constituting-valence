# The Problem of Affective Valence: Bridging the Gap Between Process and Feeling

Affective valence—the fundamental dimension of experience ranging from pleasure to displeasure, goodness to badness—is arguably one of the most pervasive and motivationally salient aspects of consciousness. It colors nearly all our perceptions, guides our decisions, and underpins our sense of well-being or suffering. Despite its phenomenological immediacy and crucial role in cognition and behavior, the nature and origin of valence remain a profound scientific and philosophical challenge, closely intertwined with the 'hard problem' of consciousness itself [@Chalmers1995]. The core question persists: **Why and how do certain neurocognitive processes feel good or bad from the first-person perspective?**

Existing theoretical frameworks often struggle to provide a fully satisfactory account.

*   **Reductive physicalist** approaches risk eliminating the subjective quality of valence, reducing it to neural firing patterns (e.g., in reward or pain circuits) or behavioral dispositions, potentially missing 'what it's like' to feel pleasure or pain.

*   **Functionalism**, while adept at explaining the causal role of valence in guiding learning and action (e.g., as a reinforcement signal), faces the challenge of explaining why the execution of a specific function should necessarily be accompanied by a particular qualitative feel (cf. Block's absent/inverted qualia arguments [@Block2013]).

*   **Dualistic** views, positing valence as a non-physical property, encounter difficulties integrating with the physical sciences and inherit the intractable interaction problem.

This paper aims to address this explanatory gap by leveraging the framework of the **Emergentist-Predictive Experience Theory (EPET)** [@Kopnin2025]. EPET, as an integrative, non-reductive physicalist theory, proposes that consciousness arises as an emergent property of integrated, embodied predictive processing. Building upon this foundation, the central question this paper seeks to answer is:

**What are the specific properties and mechanisms of the emergent predictive process, as described by EPET, that constitute affective valence?**

We will argue that EPET offers a novel perspective by providing a **constitutive explanation** of valence. Instead of searching for a mechanism that generates valence as a separate entity or property caused by neural processes, EPET hypothesizes that valence is an intrinsic, high-level property of the predictive modeling process itself, specifically related to the ongoing evaluation of interoceptive prediction errors against the organism's goals and homeostatic needs. This paper will explore how EPET aims to bridge the gap between the objective description of brain-body processes and the subjective reality of feeling good or bad, grounding affective experience within a naturalistic, scientifically plausible framework.
