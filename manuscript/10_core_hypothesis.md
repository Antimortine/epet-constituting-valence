# The Core Hypothesis of EPET: Valence as a Constitutive Property of Predictive Regulatory Architecture

Building upon the foundational commitments of EPET—namely, non-reductive emergentist physicalism, the integration of Predictive Processing (PP) and Global Workspace Theory (GWT), and the centrality of interoceptive embodiment—we propose a constitutive hypothesis regarding the nature of affective valence.

> **Affective valence is not a causally induced signal, nor a post hoc conceptual attribution, but a constitutive property of a particular configuration of predictive interoceptive regulation: one that is dynamically coherent, precision-weighted, hierarchically integrated, shaped by the predictive self-model, globally accessible within the cognitive architecture of the organism, and phenomenologically distinct from motivational impulses (approach or avoidance).**

This hypothesis intends to offer a middle path between reductive causal models (e.g., "valence is caused by changes in prediction error") and semantic-constructivist accounts (e.g., "valence is attributed to bodily states through categorization or appraisal" [@Barrett2017]). EPET argues that valence is neither *triggered* nor *projected* onto experience, but rather *emerges from within* a specific **organizational structure** of predictive control.

## Constitution vs. Causation

To clarify the conceptual commitment: we adopt a **weak emergentist identity theory**, wherein valence is **constituted by** the relational and structural properties of the organism’s embodied predictive process—rather than being merely correlated with, or caused by, those processes. Analogously to how fluidity is not *caused by* molecular motion but *is* a high-level property of molecules moving under particular conditions, **valence is what it is like**, from the system’s intrinsic perspective, **to undergo a certain mode of self-regulation.**

According to this view, the explanatory challenge is not to find a bridge law between “neural signals” and “feelings,” but to characterize which specific structural and dynamic properties of a predictive process are identical with the phenomenology of positive or negative affect.

## Key Parameters That Constitute Valence

EPET hypothesizes that valence is determined by **how well and in what manner** the interoceptive predictive system models and regulates the organism’s bodily states in relation to its survival-relevant goals. The constitutive configuration includes—but is not necessarily limited to—the following parameters, which will be elaborated in subsequent sections:

*   **Dynamics of Prediction Error / Free Energy:** The rate of change in interoceptive prediction error or free energy, where a reduction is associated with positive valence and an increase with negative valence [@JoffilyCoricelli2013; @Solms2019].
*   **Expected Prediction Error Reduction Rate (ExPERR):** Meta-inferences about the anticipated success of future error reduction, influencing prospective affect [@VandeCruys2017; @FernandezVelascoLoev2021].
*   **Interoceptive Precision Weighting:** The salience and confidence assigned to bodily error signals, modulating affective intensity [@NikolovaVuorreetal2022; @Hesp2021].
*   **Confidence in Self-Model / "Subjective Fitness":** The agent’s inferred belief in its own regulatory competence and viability [@Hesp2021].
*   **Hierarchical Coherence:** The degree of alignment and consistency across different levels of the predictive architecture, from low-level physiological signals to high-level self-narratives [@DeaneMillerWilkinson2020].
*   **Narrative Attribution and Goal Alignment:** The top-down modulation of affect through the predictive self-model's interpretation of bodily states in relation to goals and identity [@Barrett2017; @Klein2020].
*   **Global Workspace Accessibility:** The availability of the integrated, valenced interoceptive state to widespread cognitive processing via GWT mechanisms, contributing to its conscious phenomenal character [@Baars1997; @DehaeneSergentChangeux2003].

Crucially, it is not any one parameter alone that constitutes valence, but a specific **dynamic configuration**: a system actively modeling and regulating its interoceptive states, assigning context-sensitive precision to errors, aligning these states with higher-order goals, and interpreting this ongoing process through a temporally extended and context-sensitive self-model, with the resulting integrated state being globally broadcast.

## Distinction Between Valence and Motivation

EPET explicitly distinguishes valence (the phenomenal quality of affective experience) from motivational direction (approach/avoidance impulses). While often correlated, empirical evidence supports separate neural substrates and dissociable mechanisms for valence ("liking") and motivation ("wanting") [@KringelbachBerridge2009]. Valence is an internal experiential state reflecting the system's self-regulatory status; motivation is its functional translation into behavioral dispositions.

## Affective Valence as Architecturally Felt Coherence

In summary, EPET proposes that **to feel good** is to enact a mode of predictive bodily regulation that:

*   succeeds in reducing or maintaining low interoceptive prediction errors,
*   does so in a high-confidence, precision-weighted, goal-congruent way,
*   becomes globally available for further processing,
*   and is interpreted within a self-model as aligned with flourishing or viability.

Conversely, **to feel bad** is to inhabit a disordered or misaligned configuration: persistent high errors, low confidence, incoherence across bodily and narrative levels, or a perceived threat to self-represented viability, all made globally accessible.

Felt valence, therefore, is not constituted solely by prediction error structure, but by its dynamic integration with precision, self-modeling, and its availability within the global workspace—it is the system's intrinsic, first-person perspective on its own ongoing, embodied, predictive self-regulation. This is the core hypothesis from which subsequent sections derive their mechanistic, hierarchical, embodied, and phenomenological elaborations.
