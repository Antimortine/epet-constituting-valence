## Conscious Access to Valence: Integration with Global Workspace Theory

While the embodied predictive regulation of interoceptive states, modulated by the self-model, constitutes the basis and character of affective valence (as argued in Sections 2.1–2.4), EPET maintains that for this valence to become a **consciously experienced, reportable, and behaviorally integrated affective feeling**, its corresponding neural representation must achieve global accessibility within the broader cognitive architecture. To explain this crucial transition from a potentially latent or localized affective state to a phenomenally conscious one, EPET incorporates key mechanisms from **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)** and its neural instantiation, the Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) theory [@Baars1997; @DehaeneSergentChangeux2003; @Mashouretal2020conscious]. GWT/GNW posits that information becomes conscious when it is selected for widespread **broadcast** across a distributed network of specialized neural subsystems, thereby becoming available for flexible, goal-directed cognitive operations, including verbal report, memory encoding, and executive control.

> EPET proposes that affective valence, as constituted by the precision-weighted, hierarchically integrated, and self-model-interpreted interoceptive prediction error dynamics, becomes phenomenally *felt* and consciously reportable when the neural patterns realizing this valenced state **gain access to and are broadcast within the global workspace**.

This global broadcast is hypothesized to transform an embodied, architecturally encoded regulatory state into a **subjectively accessible, narratively available, and often socially expressive feeling**.

### Potential vs. Consciously Felt Valence

The predictive brain continuously generates and updates a vast number of prediction errors across multiple modalities and hierarchical levels, including those related to interoceptive states and self-referential processing. However, only a small subset of these signals and the states they represent typically:

*   Achieve sufficient **representational stability and duration**.
*   Carry sufficient **precision-weighted salience** to outcompete other signals.
*   Possess sufficient **relevance to the organism's current goals and concerns**.

Only those signals meeting such criteria are likely to win the competition for access to the limited-capacity global workspace.

> Consequently, affective valence becomes consciously felt not merely by virtue of its underlying neural processes being active in the system, but by the integrated state representing this valence *becoming globally available to and integrated within* the broader architecture of attention, language, memory, and planning.

This aligns with neuroimaging findings suggesting that conscious affective experience, particularly its subjective awareness component, correlates with coordinated activity in key interoceptive and salience-processing regions like the **anterior insula** and **dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)**, and critically, their dynamic coupling with widespread **fronto-parietal networks** implicated in the GNW [@GuHofFristonFan2013; @Craig2009how; @WhyteSmith2020predictive]. Conditions like pain asymbolia, where nociceptive signals are processed but the affective component of pain is reportedly absent, might reflect a failure of these valenced signals to achieve or maintain global broadcast, despite intact peripheral and some central processing.

### Selection Mechanisms for Global Broadcast: Precision, Salience, and Competition

In EPET, the process by which affective content gains conscious access is viewed as **competitive and resource-limited**, consistent with GWT/GNW principles. The cognitive system selects specific contents for global broadcast based on a dynamic interplay of factors, including:

*   **Signal Strength and Stability:** The magnitude and temporal stability of the neural representation of the (interoceptive) prediction error.
*   **Assigned Precision:** The estimated reliability or importance of the error signal, heavily modulated by attention and the self-model (as discussed in Sections 2.2 and 2.4). High-precision signals are prioritized.
*   **Coherence and Goal Relevance:** The consistency of the signal with ongoing cognitive frames and its relevance to the organism's active goals. Interoceptive errors signaling significant homeostatic/allostatic deviations or threats to viability are inherently goal-relevant and thus strong candidates for global access.

High-precision interoceptive prediction errors—particularly those indicating acute threat, significant bodily need, or substantial progress towards a valued goal—are therefore hypothesized to have privileged (though not guaranteed) access to the global workspace, leading to their conscious affective experience.

### Integration, Phenomenal Character, and Motivational Implications

The global broadcast of a valenced interoceptive state allows for its integration with other cognitive processes. This integration is crucial for:

*   **Shaping the full phenomenal character of the emotion:** While the core valence might be constituted by the interoceptive regulatory dynamics, its conscious "flavor" can be further enriched by associating it with memories, semantic knowledge, and ongoing perceptual input, all made available through the workspace.
*   **Enabling explicit report and communication:** Global availability is a prerequisite for verbalizing or otherwise communicating one's affective state.
*   **Informing flexible, goal-directed behavior:** Consciously accessible affective information can guide complex decision-making, planning, and behavioral adjustments beyond immediate, reflexive responses.

It is important to reiterate EPET's distinction between the **phenomenal aspect of valence** (the subjective feeling of pleasantness or unpleasantness) and its **motivational aspect** (the impulse towards approach or avoidance). While GWT/GNW provides the architectural mechanism for a valenced state to enter conscious awareness and influence cognition broadly, the subsequent translation into specific motivational drives and actions involves distinct, albeit interacting, neural pathways (e.g., dopaminergic systems for "wanting" or incentive salience, versus opioid/cannabinoid systems more closely linked to "liking" or hedonic impact) [@KringelbachBerridge2009]. The global broadcast of valence can *inform* and *bias* these motivational systems, but the generation of the conscious feeling itself is tied to the properties of the broadcasted interoceptive-predictive state. Activity in **anterior midline structures** (e.g., ventromedial prefrontal cortex, perigenual ACC), often implicated in self-referential processing and subjective feeling states, may play a key role in integrating globally broadcast affective information with the self-model, contributing to the **felt unity and personal ownership** of the affective experience [@Northoff2021self].

### Clinical and Cognitive Implications of Affective Access

This GWT-integrated framework for conscious valence has several implications:

*   **Explaining the efficacy of certain therapeutic interventions:** Practices that enhance interoceptive awareness and the ability to bring affective states into conscious focus (e.g., mindfulness, emotion-focused therapies) may work, in part, by facilitating the global broadcast and subsequent cognitive reappraisal of previously sub-threshold or poorly differentiated affective signals.
*   **Understanding dissociations in affective processing:** Conditions where subjective affective report is dissociated from physiological arousal (e.g., some forms of alexithymia or panic disorder with limited insight) might involve disruptions in the mechanisms governing the access of valenced interoceptive information to the global workspace, or its subsequent integration with the self-model.
*   **Accounting for the variable intensity of affective experience:** The "loudness" or "quietness" of an emotion can be partly understood by the degree to which its neural representation successfully competes for and dominates the global workspace.

### Summary: Conscious Valence as Globally Broadcast, Self-Modeled Interoceptive Prediction

In conclusion, EPET integrates GWT/GNW principles to explain how affective valence, fundamentally constituted by embodied, interoceptive predictive regulation and modulated by the self-model, becomes a **phenomenally conscious, narratively reportable, and motivationally significant feeling**. Conscious valence is thus not simply *added to* experience, nor is it solely a property of localized neural processing. Rather, it is **constituted by a particular dynamic configuration of predictive modeling, precision-weighting, self-interpretation, and, crucially, global accessibility within the cognitive architecture**. This global broadcast allows the valenced state to inform and be informed by the entirety of the organism's cognitive repertoire, enabling a rich and adaptive affective life.
