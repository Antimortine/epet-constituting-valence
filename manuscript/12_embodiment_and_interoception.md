## Embodiment and Interoception as the Bedrock of Valence

At the very core of EPET’s account of affective valence lies a profound commitment to the **embodied nature of consciousness** and the fundamental role of **interoception**—the multifaceted process of sensing, interpreting, integrating, and regulating signals originating from within the body [@Craig2002; @Seth2013]. While many contemporary models acknowledge the importance of interoception in emotion, EPET adopts a strong constitutive stance: affective valence is not merely *influenced* by bodily states, but is **constituted by the ongoing success or failure of the organism’s predictive modeling and regulation of its own internal milieu**, in real time, through hierarchically organized, precision-weighted interoceptive predictions. Valence, in this view, is not just *about* the body—it is, in a crucial sense, *of* the body, reflecting its moment-to-moment viability.

### Interoception as the Locus of Affective Meaning and Biological Significance

Living organisms are fundamentally defined by their continuous effort to **maintain physiological variables within adaptive ranges**—a dynamic process encompassing both **homeostasis** (reactive maintenance of stability) and **allostasis** (anticipatory regulation to meet predicted demands) [@Sterling2004]. The brain, as the central predictive organ, continuously **models, predicts, and regulates** these internal bodily states to ensure survival and flourishing. This includes monitoring and adjusting everything from energy balance, oxygenation, and temperature to immune responses and inflammatory states.

EPET posits that **interoceptive prediction error**—the mismatch between the brain's predictions about the body's internal state and the actual afferent signals received—is the primary *substrate* from which affective valence is constituted. Unlike exteroceptive prediction errors (e.g., an unexpected visual stimulus), which may or may not have immediate relevance for the organism's integrity, **interoceptive prediction errors inherently carry profound biological significance**:

*   A significant drop in predicted blood glucose levels signals an impending energy deficit.
*   Unpredicted inflammatory markers can indicate infection or tissue damage.
*   An unpredicted acceleration in heart rate might signal a metabolic response to a perceived threat or a sudden physiological challenge.

These errors are not mere informational discrepancies; they encode existential relevance. They are intrinsically "about me" and "about my current state of being," directly concerning the organism’s capacity to maintain its integrity and pursue its goals.

### The Body as the Anchor of Affective Evaluation

According to EPET, affective valence is the **felt signature of this ongoing predictive regulation of the body**. The characteristic tone of pleasantness or unpleasantness is not an epiphenomenal add-on to bodily processing; rather, it *is* the system-level, globally accessible expression of how well the organism is managing its internal states relative to its predictive models and viability goals.

*   **Positive valence** (e.g., feelings of comfort, satiety, relief, vitality) emerges when predictive models successfully anticipate and regulate internal states, leading to minimized interoceptive prediction errors or a favorable rate of error reduction.
*   **Negative valence** (e.g., feelings of pain, hunger, fatigue, anxiety) arises when persistent, high-precision interoceptive prediction errors signal dysregulation, homeostatic/allostatic imbalance, or a threat to the organism's integrity.

This perspective offers a naturalistic interpretation of various affective states:

| Affective State      | Illustrative Predictive Situation                                     | Constitutive Valence Implication        |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| Hunger/Thirst        | High-precision prediction error from energy/hydration deficit         | Increasingly strong unpleasantness      |
| Physical Pain        | High-precision error signaling actual or potential tissue damage      | Sharp, localized negative affect        |
| Comfort/Well-being   | Low interoceptive prediction error, successful homeostatic alignment  | Pleasant, stable background valence     |
| "Gut Feelings"/Anxiety | Unresolved, often low-level, interoceptive uncertainty or mismatch    | Diffuse unease or, conversely, calm     |

EPET thereby grounds the fundamental dimension of valence in the **predictive coherence (or incoherence) between the body's actual state, its predicted state, and its implicit or explicit viability-related goals**, rather than in arbitrary cognitive appraisals or purely socially constructed labels, though these higher-level factors play a crucial modulatory role (see Section 2.4).

### Embodiment and the Phenomenal Texture of Valence

The unique **phenomenal quality of affective states**—their often "dense," visceral, and deeply personal character—is, according to EPET, largely attributable to the specific neuroanatomical and neurophysiological properties of interoceptive pathways. These pathways, including the vagus nerve, lamina I spinothalamocortical projections, nucleus of the solitary tract, thalamic nuclei (e.g., VMpo), insula, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), differ significantly from exteroceptive sensory channels [@FeldmanBlissMoreauLindquist2024]. Compared to the fast, high-resolution, and often modality-specific channels of vision or audition, interoception typically provides:

*   **Lower-bandwidth but higher-biological-significance** information.
*   More **integrated, diffuse, and slowly changing** signals, reflecting global bodily states rather than highly localized external events.
*   Input that is **always already self-referential** and intrinsically linked to the organism's physiological condition.

These characteristics contribute to why **affective valence often feels global, embodied, immediate, and less amenable to purely cognitive dismissal** than, for example, a visual illusion. EPET suggests that valence is, in part, *what it is like* to experience the ongoing success or failure of the body’s complex, multi-layered self-regulation—as modeled from within the system itself.

### The Autopoietic Ground of Significance and "Care"

Enactivist and ecological critiques of standard PP models sometimes raise the "problem of significance" or "why the system cares"—why should minimizing prediction error *feel* like anything, or matter subjectively to the system [@KiversteinMillerRietveld2019]? EPET addresses this by emphasizing that for a living, embodied, autopoietic (self-producing and self-maintaining) system, **"care" is intrinsically built into its very organization**. Interoceptive prediction errors matter—and are affectively valenced—precisely because they **signal potential disruptions to biological viability, integrity, and the conditions necessary for continued self-maintenance**.

From this perspective, affective valence is not an externally assigned value or an arbitrary computational token, but rather the **predictive self-model’s intrinsic, felt orientation towards its own existential stability and flourishing**. This view aims to close the explanatory gap between objective physiological regulation and subjective existential feeling: *to feel bad* is, in a constitutive sense, to *be the kind of system that is currently failing to adequately model and regulate its own conditions of viability*—and to have this failure globally represented within its cognitive architecture.

### Summary: Valence as Embodied, Interoceptive, Viability-Oriented Predictive Regulation

In sum, EPET’s account of affective valence is fundamentally **embodied, interoceptive, and viability-oriented**. The affective tone of experience is proposed to be the architectural expression of:

*   How well the organism's predictive regulation of its internal milieu is succeeding or failing.
*   How salient (precision-weighted) the bodily deviations are deemed to be.
*   How deeply these interoceptive signals and their regulatory consequences are integrated into the predictive self-model and made globally available.

This embodied grounding helps explain why affective experience is so intimately tied to the body, why it is so powerfully motivating, and why it often possesses a raw, immediate quality that can be resistant to purely cognitive reinterpretation. The next section will elaborate on how the **predictive self-model** further modulates, contextualizes, and transforms this foundational bodily affect into the rich and nuanced landscape of human emotional life.
